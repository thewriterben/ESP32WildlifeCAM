## Reference Information

### ESP32-S3-CAM Board Specifications
```
Dimensions: ~45mm x 30mm (larger than ESP32-CAM)
Power: 3.3V (same as ESP32-CAM)
Camera: OV2640 or OV5640 options
Storage: MicroSD slot (better placement)
Programming: USB-C native (no external programmer)
Antenna: PCB + external options
```

### Expected Pin Improvements
```cpp
// Preliminary pin assignments (subject to change)
struct ESP32_S3_GPIO_Improvements {
    bool reduced_conflicts = true;      // More GPIO available
    bool native_usb = true;             // USB programming built-in
    bool better_camera_pins = true;     // Optimized camera interface
    bool external_antenna = true;       // External antenna option
    int additional_gpios = 8;           // Estimated additional pins
};
```
