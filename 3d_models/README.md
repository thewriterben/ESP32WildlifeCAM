## Printing Guidelines

### Recommended Settings
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm
- **Infill**: 20-30%
- **Material**: PETG or ABS (outdoor durability)
- **Support**: Required for overhangs >45°

### Material Recommendations

**Outdoor Deployment:**
- PETG: Good UV resistance, easier to print
- ABS: Higher temperature resistance
- ASA: Best UV resistance for long-term outdoor use

**Indoor/Short-term:**
- PLA: Easy to print, adequate for testing

## Assembly Instructions

### Enclosure Assembly
1. Print main body and lid components
2. Install camera module in camera mount
3. Route cables through designated openings
4. Secure electronics with mounting screws
5. Apply weatherproof seal to lid

### Mounting System
1. Select appropriate mounting bracket for deployment location
2. Print mounting hardware with 100% infill for strength
3. Use stainless steel bolts for outdoor installation
4. Apply thread locker to prevent loosening

## Weatherproofing

- Use silicone sealant around cable entry points
- Install rubber gasket in lid groove
- Ensure proper drainage for condensation
- Consider desiccant packets for humid environments

## Customization

The 3D models are designed to be easily customizable:
- Modify mounting points for different hardware
- Adjust enclosure size for additional components
- Add ventilation features if needed
- Customize mounting brackets for specific installations

## Print Testing

Before final deployment, test print with:
1. Dimensional accuracy verification
2. Fit test with actual hardware
3. Weather seal effectiveness
4. Mounting system strength

## Post-Processing

- Sand contact surfaces for smooth fit
- Drill out mounting holes to final size
- Apply UV-resistant coating if using PLA
- Test assembly before field deployment
