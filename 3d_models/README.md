# 3D Printable Enclosure System

## Wildlife Camera Weatherproof Housing Design

### Overview

This directory contains 3D printable designs for a complete weatherproof enclosure system for the ESP32 Wildlife Camera. The design prioritizes weather resistance, ease of assembly, and field serviceability while maintaining cost-effectiveness through 3D printing.

### Design Philosophy

#### Weather Resistance (IP65 Rating)
- **Sealed joints** with O-ring grooves
- **Angled surfaces** to shed water
- **Ventilation** with moisture barriers
- **UV resistance** through material selection
- **Thermal expansion** accommodation

#### Modularity
- **Separable components** for easy assembly
- **Standardized mounting** interfaces
- **Serviceable design** for field maintenance
- **Expandable architecture** for future accessories

```

**Lid:**
```
Orientation: Gasket groove facing down
Supports: Bridge supports for overhangs
Surface finish: Top surface critical for appearance
```

**Mounting Components:**
```
Orientation: Strongest axis aligned with primary loads
Support strategy: Dissolvable supports preferred
Critical dimensions: Verify post-print accuracy
```

### Assembly Instructions

#### Pre-Assembly Preparation
```
1. Remove support material carefully
2. Test-fit all components before final assembly
3. Drill pilot holes for metal inserts if used
4. Clean all gasket surfaces thoroughly
5. Apply thread locker to external fasteners
```
