## 🚀 Immediate Next Actions (Week of September 1-7, 2025)

### Priority 1: Complete Camera Integration
**Effort**: 12-16 hours  
**Blocker Removal**: This unblocks all subsequent development  
**Tasks**:
1. Implement image capture in `board_node.cpp` (TODO line 596)
2. Integrate with motion detection triggers
3. Validate end-to-end workflow: motion → camera → storage
4. Test power management coordination during camera operations

### Priority 2: Network Foundation 
**Effort**: 20-24 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Camera integration completion  
**Tasks**:
1. Implement coordinator discovery trigger (`multi_board_system.cpp:223`)
2. Add data transmission implementation (`board_node.cpp:596`)
3. Implement signal strength and hop count calculation (`discovery_protocol.cpp:289-290`)

### Priority 3: Hardware Decision
**Timeline**: Within 2 weeks  
**Options**:
- Continue with AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM (WiFi-only networking)
- Migrate to ESP32-S3-CAM (full LoRa + WiFi capabilities)
- Develop LoRa addon board solution

## 📊 Quality Metrics Achieved

### TODO Reduction Progress
- **Baseline**: 58+ TODO items (estimated from problem statement)
