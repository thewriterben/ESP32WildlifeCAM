### Layer Stack-up Design

#### Top Layer (Component Side)
```
- Component placement and local routing
- High-speed signals (camera data, SPI)
- Analog signals (ADC inputs)
- Decoupling capacitor placement
```

#### Bottom Layer (Solder Side)
```
- Ground plane (split as needed)
- Power distribution (3.3V, battery)
- Return paths for high-speed signals
- Backup routing for non-critical signals
```

### Routing Guidelines

#### Critical Signal Routing

**Camera Parallel Interface:**
```
- Match trace lengths for data lines (±0.5mm)
- Use 75Ω controlled impedance
- Minimize vias and layer changes
- Shield clock signals from data lines
- Place termination resistors close to receiver
```

**SPI Bus (LoRa):**
```
- Keep traces short (<50mm if possible)
- Use 50Ω controlled impedance
- Route clock trace separate from data
- Add test points for debugging
- Consider series termination resistors
```

**I2C Bus (Sensors):**
```
- Use 100Ω series resistors for signal integrity
- Pull-up resistors: 4.7kΩ for 3.3V operation
- Keep total trace length <300mm
- Avoid routing over switching circuits
```

#### Power Distribution

**Battery Power:**
```
Trace Width Calculation:
- Current: 500mA max (burst)
- Temperature Rise: <10°C
- Recommended Width: 0.5mm minimum
- Use multiple vias for layer transitions
```

**3.3V Rail:**
```
Trace Width: 0.3mm minimum
Decoupling Strategy:
- 100µF bulk capacitor near power input
- 10µF ceramic near each IC
- 100nF high-frequency bypass
- Place capacitors <5mm from IC pins
```

**Ground Plane:**
```
- Solid ground plane on bottom layer
- Minimize splits in ground plane
- Use ground stitching vias every 5mm
- Star ground point for analog circuits
```

### Component Placement Strategy

#### Power Section Layout
```
[Solar Input] → [Protection Diode] → [TP4056] → [Battery Connector]
                                        ↓
                                   [Power LEDs]
                                        ↓
                                   [ESP32 Power]
```

#### Sensitive Analog Placement
```
- Voltage dividers away from switching circuits
- BME280 sensor isolated from heat sources
- ADC input filtering close to ESP32
- Guard rings around precision circuits
```

#### RF Section Considerations
```
LoRa Module Placement:
- Corner of PCB for antenna access
- Ground plane clearance around antenna
- Keep digital switching circuits away
- Add RF shielding if needed

Antenna Routing:
- 50Ω controlled impedance
- No vias in antenna trace
- Ground plane clearance: 3x trace width
- SMA connector at board edge
```

### Thermal Management

#### Heat Dissipation
```
ESP32-S3: Up to 500mW power dissipation
- Thermal vias under IC package
- Ground plane for heat spreading
- Keep temperature sensors away

TP4056 Charging IC:
- Thermal pad connection to ground plane
- Current limiting for thermal protection
- Heat sink consideration for high current
```

#### Component Temperature Ratings
```
Operating Range: -20°C to +60°C
- Derate components for extreme temperatures
- Use automotive grade components if available
- Consider conformal coating for moisture
```

### Signal Integrity Analysis

#### High-Speed Signals (Camera)
```
Clock Frequency: Up to 24MHz
Rise Time: ~2ns
Critical Length: 30mm (1/6 wavelength)

Mitigation Strategies:
- Controlled impedance routing
- Minimize stub lengths
- Use ground planes for return current
- Consider differential signaling for clock
```

#### Power Supply Noise
```
Switching Frequency: ESP32 internal switching
Noise Budget: <50mV peak-to-peak

Suppression Techniques:
- Multiple decoupling capacitor values
- Low ESR capacitors for high frequency
- Ferrite beads on power lines if needed
- Separate analog and digital supplies
```

### Manufacturing Considerations

#### Assembly Process
```
1. SMD component placement (bottom side first)
2. Reflow soldering profile optimization
3. Through-hole component insertion
4. Wave soldering or selective soldering
5. Cleaning and inspection
6. Functional testing
```

#### DFM (Design for Manufacturing)
```
- Minimum feature sizes within capability
- Adequate clearance for pick-and-place
- Fiducial markers for automated assembly
- Test points accessible for ICT
- Panel design for production efficiency
```

#### Quality Control
```
Electrical Tests:
- In-circuit test (ICT) for component values
- Functional test of all major subsystems
- Power consumption verification
- RF performance validation

Visual Inspection:
- Solder joint quality
- Component orientation
- Silk screen legibility
- Surface finish integrity
```

### Design Verification

#### Pre-production Checklist
```

#### Testing Strategy
```
1. Bare board electrical test
2. Populated board power-on test
3. Functional verification of each subsystem
4. Environmental stress testing
5. Long-term reliability assessment
